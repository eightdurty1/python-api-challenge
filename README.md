Weather Analysis Near the Equator
Project Overview
Data’s true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. This project leverages Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: “What is the weather like as we approach the equator?”

While it may seem obvious that it gets hotter, this project aims to provide concrete evidence to support that claim.

Technologies Used
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data analysis and visualization.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Git: For version control and collaboration.
Methodology
Data Collection:

Utilize the OpenWeatherMap API to gather weather data for over 500 cities worldwide.
Ensure a diverse range of cities at varying distances from the equator.
Data Processing:

Use Pandas to clean and organize the data.
Extract relevant information such as temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed.
Data Visualization:

Create scatter plots to showcase relationships between latitude and weather parameters.
Perform linear regression analysis to identify trends.
